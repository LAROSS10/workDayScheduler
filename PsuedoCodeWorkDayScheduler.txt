GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
-I will need code that enters the current date,formatted correctly directly into the DOM in the right plae
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
-Several Divs to represent the different time blocks
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
-here I need code that will determine the difference between the current time and past, present or future times to then color code the different time blocks
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
-text submit fields within each time block
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
-save to local storage
localstorage.set
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
